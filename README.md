# Time Bank

## What is a time bank?
It is in it's name, a bank where the only currency is time! Namely, it is a reciprocity-based work trading system in which hours are the currency. With time banking, a person with one skill set can bank and trade hours of work for equal hours of work in another skill set instead of paying or being paid for services. In addition, the hours banked are always traded equally regardless of the services rendered. This equality is intended to foster ties in communities and, by making all contributions valued equally, encourage equality in the communities themselves.


## What is the purpose of this website?
A time bank has always existed in theory; however, it has never been implemented... at least not as a social website. Hence, the purpose of this website is to bring life to the time bank by allowing users to create an account, post trades, see other trades that might be suitable for them and so on.
